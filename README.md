# Project-2
# Whole Foods Recipe App 
Our app uses the Whole Foods API to pull up sale items at Whole Foods Stores. We utilize these items to then populate a recipe page that relates to the sale items. We will be storing our data in MYSQL. We will also have a map page that displays the closest Whole Foods Store. 
Our extra libraries will be Materialize and Green Sock.
